# COVID19-XRay-Classification
# ðŸ¦  COVID-19 X-Ray Image Classification

This project classifies chest X-ray images into categories such as **COVID-19**, **Viral Pneumonia**, and **Normal** using deep learning and transfer learning techniques.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- âœ… Built with TensorFlow/Keras
- âœ… Uses pre-trained models like Xception, VGG16, MobileNetV2, etc.
- âœ… Augments and processes image data for better performance
- âœ… Applies Transfer Learning for high accuracy in medical imaging

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pranavraikokte/covid19-image-dataset)
- Structure:
  - `train/` â€” Labeled X-ray images
  - `test/` â€” Unlabeled images for evaluation

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

- Utilizes pre-trained CNN models with custom top layers
- Input shape: `224x224x3`
- Output: Softmax over 3 classes
- Data augmentation: Rotation, zoom, shear, flip
- Trained with categorical crossentropy loss and Adam optimizer
